Examples:\n\n- Doesn't use the icon component internally, because it is literally one line of jade.\n- Doesn't have components for cards/tables, provides stylus mixins instead.\n\nBuntpapier tries to make the prefix configurable (working for vue and stylus, missing for jade classes)\n\n## Inspiration\nBuntpapier is heavily inspired by KeenUI and Material-UI.\n","created":"2016-08-13T19:30:19.628Z","modified":"2017-05-15T15:38:33.051Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"rash","email":"rashfael@isobeef.org"},"owners":[{"name":"rash","email":"rashfael@isobeef.org"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"buntpapier","_nodeVersion":"7.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/buntpapier-0.17.0.tgz_1494862711918_0.2757117636501789"},"_npmUser":{"name":"rash","email":"rashfael@isobeef.org"},"_npmVersion":"4.5.0","_rev":"26-732f11dc7e7e050662c7e79143ff6909","_shasum":"430b1a8b82aa7f3801214eb84b240b77a93260a1","author":{"name":"rashfael","email":"rashfael@isobeef.org"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/rashfael/buntpapier/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.17.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"430b1a8b82aa7f3801214eb84b240b77a93260a1","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/buntpapier/-/buntpapier-0.17.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"rash","email":"rashfael@isobeef.org"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-15T15:38:33.051Z","created":"2016-08-13T19:30:19.628Z","0.0.0":"2016-08-13T19:30:19.628Z","0.1.0":"2016-09-26T14:37:08.500Z","0.2.0":"2016-09-26T14:52:40.691Z","0.2.1":"2016-09-26T15:02:53.837Z","0.3.0":"2016-09-28T12:30:09.903Z","0.3.1":"2016-09-28T13:50:44.020Z","0.4.0":"2016-09-29T11:28:45.159Z","0.5.0":"2016-09-29T12:49:42.391Z","0.6.0":"2016-09-30T12:35:45.175Z","0.6.1":"2016-10-04T13:46:51.014Z","0.7.0":"2016-10-07T11:52:22.969Z","0.7.1":"2016-10-07T12:04:33.092Z","0.7.2":"2016-10-07T13:26:41.486Z","0.8.0":"2016-10-09T21:06:13.110Z","0.8.1":"2016-10-10T09:26:36.968Z","0.8.2":"2016-10-10T09:29:32.619Z","0.8.3":"2016-10-10T09:30:50.395Z","0.8.4":"2016-10-10T13:53:47.652Z","0.9.0":"2016-11-16T15:15:57.731Z","0.10.0":"2016-12-15T16:10:21.312Z","0.11.0":"2016-12-19T12:52:32.111Z","0.12.0":"2016-12-28T16:32:31.394Z","0.12.1":"2016-12-29T13:20:32.712Z","0.12.2":"2016-12-29T15:55:27.585Z","0.13.0":"2017-01-16T16:26:50.269Z","0.13.1":"2017-01-26T13:40:07.782Z","0.13.2":"2017-02-03T11:11:07.119Z","0.14.0":"2017-02-15T10:41:29.583Z","0.14.1":"2017-02-16T16:26:05.954Z","0.14.2":"2017-02-23T13:33:13.061Z","0.14.3":"2017-03-17T13:54:51.464Z","0.14.4":"2017-03-17T14:00:39.706Z","0.14.5":"2017-03-17T14:04:07.698Z","0.14.6":"2017-03-17T14:32:27.477Z","0.14.7":"2017-03-17T18:47:49.469Z","0.15.0":"2017-04-28T11:36:20.165Z","0.15.1":"2017-04-28T11:49:13.136Z","0.15.2":"2017-04-28T12:17:57.240Z","0.15.3":"2017-04-28T12:27:29.411Z","0.15.4":"2017-04-28T14:32:10.755Z","0.15.5":"2017-04-28T14:33:34.518Z","0.16.0":"2017-05-15T11:41:15.328Z","0.17.0":"2017-05-15T15:38:33.051Z"}}}
