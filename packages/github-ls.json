However: the \ngithub file listings of `github-ls` tend to have a latency issue. It takes\na little bit of time until the github changes are reflected in the svn variant.\nMore importantly, the access to the files using\n`https://raw.githubusercontent.com` is cached for several minutes! In order to\nget accurate and up-to-date files `github-ls` also supports the use of the\ngithub api to lookup files.\n\n### Github API in the Command Line\nAll you have to do in the command line is to specify the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`:\n\n```bash\n$ env GITHUB_TOKEN=\"6522-this-is-not-a-token-52bf8226de22868\" github-ls martinheidegger/github-ls\n```\n\n### Github API with JavaScript\nInstantiate a [github4]() client and pass it in as second parameter to github-ls. Note: This requires a version of github4 that includes [PR#97](https://github.com/kaizensoze/node-github/pull/97).\n\n```JavaScript\nvar Client = require('github4')\nvar client = new Client({\n    version: '3.0.0',\n    headers: {\n        'user-agent': 'my-app-user-agent' \n    }\n})\ngithub-ls('martinheidegger/github-ls', client, function (err, list) {\n    // process the list\n})\n```\n\n\n## State\nRight now it _should basically work_ but the error messages might be wildly\nunhelpful. If you find any problem, please don't hesitate to\n[post an issue](https://github.com/martinheidegger/github-ls/issues/new) or\n[create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\n## Tests\nTo run the tests you need to have a `test_auth.json` file in your project \nfolder that contains a valid github token. Example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"token\": \"6522-this-is-not-a-token-52bf8226de22868\"\n}\n```\n\n## Thanks\nI would like to thank [s9tpepper](https://github.com/s9tpepper) for helping me\nfind a good way and motivating me. I also would like to say that I wouldn't\nhave had the idea without the push from [fforres](https://github.com/fforres),\n[bnb](https://github.com/bnb) and [dinodsaurus](https://github.com/dinodsaurus)\nthat work with me on [nodeschool-admin](https://github.com/nodeschool/admin)\nand [iancrowther](https://github.com/iancrowther) who motivates me to work on nodeschool in general.\n\n`github-ls` builds on the great work of\n[hyperquest](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest),\n[cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) and\n[stream-to-array](https://github.com/stream-utils/stream-to-array) without\nthose libraries it would have been way more work! You guys rock!\n\n\n","created":"2016-03-16T12:33:03.421Z","modified":"2016-04-05T16:27:22.543Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"leichtgewicht","email":"martin.heidegger@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"leichtgewicht","email":"martin.heidegger@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"github-ls","_nodeVersion":"5.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/github-ls-1.1.0.tgz_1459873642080_0.35377310984767973"},"_npmUser":{"name":"leichtgewicht","email":"martin.heidegger@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.8.3","_rev":"1-249c390917a952330263c91cbb885f08","_shasum":"d9ea343fa16ca70552c00d65e33c2b00b9183ae2","author":"","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/martinheidegger/github-ls/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.1.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"d9ea343fa16ca70552c00d65e33c2b00b9183ae2","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/github-ls/-/github-ls-1.1.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"leichtgewicht","email":"martin.heidegger@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","time":{"modified":"2016-04-05T16:27:22.543Z","created":"2016-03-16T12:33:03.421Z","0.0.1":"2016-03-16T12:33:03.421Z","1.0.0":"2016-03-17T05:40:51.011Z","1.0.1":"2016-04-02T05:46:56.528Z","1.0.2":"2016-04-02T05:49:57.563Z","1.0.3":"2016-04-02T07:50:55.783Z","1.0.4":"2016-04-02T13:57:17.676Z","1.1.0":"2016-04-05T16:27:22.543Z"}}}
