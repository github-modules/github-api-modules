This default rate limiting might not be enough to meet the needs of an application that intensively communicates with the GitHub API.\n\nSee [Rate Limiting](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting) for more details.\n\nThe solution\n------------\n\nIf a GitHub API response contains either an `Etag` or `Last-Modified` HTTP header, `ghrequest` will locally cache the response of such request and will send `If-None-Match` or `If-Modified-Since` request headers when the same API resource is called again. If GitHub responds with a `304` code, this means that the content of the response didn't change, so we fetch it from the local cache and your rate limit remains intact.\n\nSee [Conditional Requests](https://developer.github.com/v3/#conditional-requests) for more details.\n\nThis is handled for you automatically so you don't have to bother messing with HTTP headers yourself.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall `ghrequest` by running:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save ghrequest\n```\n\nDefaults\n--------\n\nThis module includes the following modifications to `request`:\n\n- A `baseUrl` option that defaults to the public GitHub API url. This allows you to pass a relative url instead of having to type the full url every time.\n\n- The `json` option is set to `true`, so JSON is encoded/decoded for you automatically.\n\n- An `Accept` HTTP header that defaults to `application/vnd.github.v3+json`, [as recommended by GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/#request-specific-version).\n\n- A `per_page` query string that defaults to `100`, which is the maximum supported value by GitHub, with the intention of getting to most of every request in paginated resources.\n\nMake sure you check the [request documentation](https://github.com/request/request) to understand what the mentioned options do in greater detail.\n\nNotice that *all mentioned modifications* are overwritable.\n\nUser Agent\n----------\n\nYou **MUST** include a `User-Agent` HTTP header, otherwise [GitHub will reject your request](https://developer.github.com/v3/#user-agent-required).\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nghrequest({\n  url: '/foo',\n  headers: {\n    'User-Agent': 'My Cool App'\n  }\n}, function(error, response, body) {\n  if (error) throw error;\n  console.log(body);\n});\n```\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n<a name=\"ghrequest\"></a>\n## ghrequest(options, callback)\nSee [request](https://github.com/request/request) for more details about how to use this function.\n\n**Kind**: global function  \n**Summary**: Make an HTTP to the GitHub API  \n**Access:** public  \n\n| Param | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| options | <code>Object</code> | request options |\n| callback | <code>function</code> | callback (error, response, body) |\n\n**Example**  \n```js\n// Anonymous Request\nghrequest({\n method: 'GET',\n url: '/repos/angular/angular/issues'\n}, function(error, response, body) {\n if (error) throw error;\n console.log(body);\n});\n```\n**Example**  \n```js\n// Basic Authentication\nghrequest({\n method: 'GET',\n url: '/repos/angular/angular/issues',\n auth: {\n   user: 'johndoe',\n   pass: 'secret'\n }\n}, function(error, response, body) {\n if (error) throw error;\n console.log(body);\n});\n```\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you're having any problem, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/issuetrackapp/ghrequest/issues/new) on GitHub and the IssueTrack team will be happy to help.\n\nTests\n-----\n\nRun the test suite by doing:\n\n```sh\n$ gulp test\n```\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n- Issue Tracker: [github.com/issuetrackapp/ghrequest/issues](https://github.com/issuetrackapp/ghrequest/issues)\n- Source Code: [github.com/issuetrackapp/ghrequest](https://github.com/issuetrackapp/ghrequest)\n\nBefore submitting a PR, please make sure that you include tests, and that [jshint](http://jshint.com) runs without any warning:\n\n```sh\n$ gulp lint\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe project is licensed under the MIT license.\n","created":"2015-10-04T01:28:28.491Z","modified":"2015-10-04T01:28:28.491Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jviotti","email":"jviottidc@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jviotti","email":"jviottidc@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"ghrequest","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"jviotti","email":"jviottidc@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-6eda536b0e4abea36855694a9434d16a","_shasum":"e6136e507e9cf5cd0ae0d82ba7199f9635e74471","author":{"name":"Juan Cruz Viotti","email":"jviottidc@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/issuetrackapp/ghrequest/issues"},"directories":{"test":"tests"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"e6136e507e9cf5cd0ae0d82ba7199f9635e74471","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/ghrequest/-/ghrequest-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jviotti","email":"jviottidc@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-10-04T01:28:28.491Z","created":"2015-10-04T01:28:28.491Z","1.0.0":"2015-10-04T01:28:28.491Z"}}}
