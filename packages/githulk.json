In addition to\nproviding access to Github's official API's it also implements new methods that\nare either convenience functions or a composition of multiple API calls which will\nmake certain actions easier or more natural.\n\n## Installation\n\nThis module is released in to the npm registry as `githulk`:\n\n```\nnpm install --save githulk\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe GitHulk module is exposed as a single function (constructor) and can\ntherefor be required as:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar GitHulk = require('githulk');\n```\n\nTo initialise a new GitHulk instance simply construct it using:\n\n```js\nvar githulk = new GitHulk(/* optional options */);\n```\n\nAs you've might have noticed from the function call above, it accepts an\noptional options object. The following options can be provided:\n\n- `url`: The API endpoint of the Github API (with trailing slash).\n- `maxdelay`: Maximum delay for exponential back off.\n- `mindelay`: Minimum delay for exponential back off.\n- `retries`: Amount of retries before finally giving up.\n- `factor`: Exponential back off factor.\n- `cache`: A cache for conditional lookups.\n- `user`: A Github username (see Authorization)\n- `password`: A Github password (see Authorization)\n- `token`: A oauth token (see Authorization)\n\n### Authorization\n\nIf no options are supplied your API calls will be severely limited by GitHub and\na really low rate limiting of 60 API calls per hour will be in place. In order\nto authorize the GitHulk instance you can provide it with:\n\n- `token`: An oauth token for your application.\n- `user`, `password`: The user and password of your account (for basic auth).\n- `authorization`: A predefined authorization header for each request.\n\nIn addition to supplying your authorization details through the constructor of\nthe function we also support them through `ENV` variables. Set the\n`GITHULK_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` variable with your oauth token and we will use\nthat automaticaly.\n\n### Arguments\n\nAll API endpoints follow the same function signature, the order in which they\nare provided does not matter. The only argument that is optional is the\n`options` argument.\n\n- `project`: An **string** that has the username/repo combination.\n- `options`: An **object** with additional configuration for the API method.\n- `fn`: An **function** which is called with an error first callback pattern.\n\nThe following API endpoints are implemented, they are currently implemented on\na need to have basis:\n\n### .repository\n\n- `githulk.repository.contents`\n- `githulk.repository.readme`\n- `githulk.repository.raw`\n- `githulk.repository.moved`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","created":"2014-02-17T19:20:17.947Z","modified":"2017-05-22T20:04:11.067Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},"owners":[{"email":"info@martijnswaagman.nl","name":"swaagie"},{"email":"charlie.robbins@gmail.com","name":"indexzero"},{"email":"jcrugzz@gmail.com","name":"jcrugzz"},{"email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com","name":"3rdeden"},{"email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com","name":"v1"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"githulk","_nodeVersion":"7.5.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/githulk-1.2.1.tgz_1490642404854_0.13446907559409738"},"_npmUser":{"name":"3rdeden","email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com"},"_npmVersion":"4.1.2","_rev":"4-0dda17cec9edd4a9d3dbaa0d830c6845","_shasum":"b70f9f47e6e2d7419c2048d9a0e6110b4a009c3f","author":{"name":"Arnout Kazemier"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.2.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"b70f9f47e6e2d7419c2048d9a0e6110b4a009c3f","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/githulk/-/githulk-1.2.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"email":"info@martijnswaagman.nl","name":"swaagie"},{"email":"charlie.robbins@gmail.com","name":"indexzero"},{"email":"jcrugzz@gmail.com","name":"jcrugzz"},{"email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com","name":"3rdeden"},{"email":"npm@3rd-Eden.com","name":"v1"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-05-22T20:04:11.067Z","created":"2014-02-17T19:20:17.947Z","0.0.0":"2014-02-17T19:20:17.947Z","0.0.2":"2014-02-20T08:51:25.721Z","0.0.3":"2014-02-21T22:27:20.916Z","0.0.4":"2014-02-25T13:47:42.389Z","0.0.5":"2014-03-13T14:52:51.311Z","0.0.6":"2014-03-24T18:15:47.348Z","0.0.7":"2014-04-01T16:18:00.087Z","0.1.0":"2014-05-12T09:53:53.141Z","0.1.2":"2014-07-04T09:39:30.424Z","0.1.3":"2014-07-14T02:57:18.312Z","0.1.4":"2014-07-23T08:25:02.028Z","0.2.0":"2014-11-14T22:16:41.732Z","0.2.1":"2015-02-06T10:13:18.283Z","0.3.0":"2015-11-05T08:15:15.240Z","1.0.0":"2015-11-11T00:18:51.145Z","1.0.1":"2015-11-11T22:05:17.941Z","1.1.0":"2015-11-24T17:44:02.589Z","1.1.1":"2016-06-24T20:12:45.388Z","1.1.2":"2016-07-07T14:15:11.905Z","1.2.0":"2017-03-27T19:15:27.744Z","1.2.1":"2017-03-27T19:20:05.495Z"}}}
