Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n    npm install github-api --save-dev\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n    grunt.loadNpmTasks('github-api');\n\nRun this task with the `grunt github` command.\n\nTask targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe github-api module accepts options at both the global and local task level. Special options include `oAuth`, `filters` and `screenDump`.\n\n### Options\n\n- `oAuth` - contain two specific properties; `client_id` and `client_secret`. These credentials are provided by Github, and need to be created by a user with corrent permissions before any secure query will work. Additional information about Github and oAuth2 can be found in their [oAuth documentation](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).\n\n- `filters` - should contain the filtering parameters avaliable to the `src` query defined. Additional information about specific filters can be found in the [Github Developer Documentation](http://developer.github.com/).\n\n- `screenDump` - boolean flag to used to determine if the returned JSON should be dumped to the screen. (default is `false`)\n\n### Targets\n\n- `src` - is the specified API query path. Soruce paths are everything that appears after `api.github.com`. Additional information about different query paths can be found in the [Github Developer Documentation](http://developer.github.com/).\n\n- `dest` - is the path and filename where the retured request should be saved.\n\nExample\n```js\ngithub: {\n    options: {\n        oAuth: {\n            'client_id': 'XXXXXXXXXXXX',\n            'client_secret': 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'\n        }\n    },\n    changelog: {\n        options: {\n            filters: {\n                'state': 'open'\n            }\n        },\n        src: '/repos/:org/:repo1/issues', // Get a JSON file for all open issues from repo1\n        dest: 'open.json'\n    }\n}\n```\n","versions":[{"number":"0.1.0","date":"2013-04-27T18:23:01.185Z"},{"number":"0.1.1","date":"2013-04-27T18:24:55.939Z"},{"number":"0.1.2","date":"2013-05-10T15:40:07.990Z"},{"number":"0.1.3","date":"2013-08-09T14:07:08.223Z"},{"number":"0.2.0","date":"2013-09-13T00:50:39.045Z"},{"number":"0.2.1","date":"2013-09-13T12:45:15.137Z"},{"number":"0.2.2","date":"2013-10-10T23:12:02.722Z"},{"number":"0.2.3","date":"2013-10-30T01:21:10.435Z"}],"starsCount":1,"created":"2013-04-27T18:22:58.549Z","modified":"2017-03-12T11:54:42.392Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"jeffherb","email":"herb.jeff@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"jeffherb","email":"herb.jeff@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"grunt-github-api","_npmUser":{"name":"jeffherb","email":"herb.jeff@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.3.11","_rev":"2-9196e1267347a84ee2737ef8d8878125","author":{"name":"Jeffrey Herb","email":"herb.jeff@gmail.com","url":"https://github.com/jeffHerb"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/assemble/grunt-github-api/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.3"},"dist":{"shasum":"05de2a62d35c06eab98ac0b231cfb246ccac7d02","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-github-api/-/grunt-github-api-0.2.3.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"jeffherb","email":"herb.jeff@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-12T11:54:42.392Z","created":"2013-04-27T18:22:58.549Z","0.1.0":"2013-04-27T18:23:01.185Z","0.1.1":"2013-04-27T18:24:55.939Z","0.1.2":"2013-05-10T15:40:07.990Z","0.1.3":"2013-08-09T14:07:08.223Z","0.2.0":"2013-09-13T00:50:39.045Z","0.2.1":"2013-09-13T12:45:15.137Z","0.2.2":"2013-10-10T23:12:02.722Z","0.2.3":"2013-10-30T01:21:10.435Z"},"users":{"tamer1an":true}}}
