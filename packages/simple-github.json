This might turn out to be a bad idea but I don't\nknow better for now.\n\nBecause what I want to do is use the API as quickly as possible, this module\nsupports copy pasting the URLs directly from the documentation:\n\n``` js\nvar gh = require(\"simple-github\")({\n  owner: \"tobie\",\n  repo: \"simple-github\"\n});\n\ngh.request(\"GET /repos/:owner/:repo/commits\").then(console.log);\n```\n\nInterpolation is automatic.\n\nSimilarly, simple-github also accepts URI templates (as these are common in\nthe GitHub API):\n\n``` js\nvar gh = require(\"simple-github\")({\n  owner: \"tobie\",\n  repo: \"simple-github\"\n});\n\ngh.request(\"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits\", { method: \"get\" }).then(console.log);\n```\n","created":"2013-10-21T21:00:18.154Z","modified":"2017-03-06T11:08:54.449Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"tobie","email":"tobie@codespeaks.com"},"owners":[{"name":"tobie","email":"tobie.langel@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"simple-github","_nodeVersion":"6.10.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/simple-github-0.8.0.tgz_1488798532713_0.03760433360002935"},"_npmUser":{"name":"tobie","email":"tobie@codespeaks.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.10","_rev":"6-d98285c15095724b69bf2804737c7e89","_shasum":"3c705797918926668d3a14436ca4d45c6e74212c","author":{"name":"Tobie Langel"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tobie/simple-github/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.8.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"3c705797918926668d3a14436ca4d45c6e74212c","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/simple-github/-/simple-github-0.8.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"tobie","email":"tobie.langel@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-06T11:08:54.449Z","created":"2013-10-21T21:00:18.154Z","0.1.0":"2013-10-21T21:00:23.925Z","0.2.0":"2014-04-06T16:32:54.150Z","0.3.0":"2016-10-13T08:09:36.437Z","0.4.0":"2017-02-09T13:00:28.103Z","0.5.0":"2017-02-09T16:28:24.747Z","0.6.0":"2017-02-16T01:36:34.077Z","0.7.0":"2017-02-23T00:13:04.829Z","0.8.0":"2017-03-06T11:08:54.449Z"}}}
