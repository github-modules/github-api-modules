Now that you are bootstrapped in, have a look at all the methods available to you in the extensive JSDoc API documentation available on [these auto-generated GitLab Pages](https://clorichel.gitlab.io/vue-github-api/Vue_GitHubAPI.html).\n\n**Important:** if you want your filled-in property `this.myGitHubData.projects` to be reactive \"the Vue.js way\", you MUST define this variable as a data in your components or vues, with a default value of an empty object (read `myGitHubData: {}`). See how to do it on a vue component on this example:\n\n```javascript\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p>Repositories grabbed: {{ repositoriesCount }}</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return {\n      myGitHubData: {}\n    }\n  },\n  mounted: function () {\n    this.GitHubAPI.get('/user/repos', {}, [this.myGitHubData, 'repositories'])\n  },\n  computed: {\n    repositoriesCount: function () {\n      if (this.myGitHubData.repositories) {\n        return this.myGitHubData.repositories.length\n      }\n      return 'none yet...'\n    }\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is due to the fact Vue does not allow to add new reactive properties dynamically. Read more about it on the awesome [Vue.js guide](http://vuejs.org/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats).\n\nDuring your application workflow, you could want to change GitHub user authentication token. This method will let you do it easily:\n\n```javascript\n// set application wide GitHubAPI token value\nthis.GitHubAPI.setToken('other user Personal Access Token')\n```\n\n## Vuex store module\n\nUsing Vuex? You can attach _vue-github-api_ Vuex module to your application store. Within one of your `.vue` components, simply register it before you using it from your application:\n\n```javascript\n// registers GitHubAPI Vuex module to your application Vuex store\nthis.GitHubAPI.registerStore(this.$store)\n\n// you are now able to read this state\nthis.$store.state.GitHubAPI.downloading\n```\n\nHere are Vuex `states` provided by _vue-github-api_ to your application:\n\n| Vuex state    | Type    | Description                                        |\n|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| `downloading` | Boolean | Defines if vue-github-api is currently downloading |\n| `running`     | Number  | Count vue-github-api requests running now          |\n\nHave a look at [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) for more details, or read on this complete example:\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\n\n// your application is using Vuex\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nVue.use(Vuex)\n\n// remember vue-resource is needed for vue-github-api\nimport VueResource from 'vue-resource'\nVue.use(VueResource)\n\n// using vue-github-api\nimport GitHubAPI from 'vue-github-api'\nVue.use(GitHubAPI, { token: 'user Private Token' })\n\n// declare your Vuex store\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({})\n\n// this is your application\nconst app = new Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  mounted: {\n    // register GitHubAPI Vuex store!\n    this.GitHubAPI.registerStore(store)\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // with this computed property, do something insanely simple such as:\n    // <p v-if=\"downloading\">Downloading from GitHub...</p>\n    downloading: function () {\n      if (typeof store.state.GitHubAPI !== 'undefined') {\n        return store.state.GitHubAPI.downloading\n      } else {\n        return false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nInitial scaffolding was done with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) webpack template. For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).\n\nSimply said, one can start working on its own customized version of _vue-github-api_ in no time:\n\n``` bash\n# install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# run unit tests\nnpm run unit\n\n# build JSDoc API documentation (defaults to the ./out folder)\n./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc src/GitHubAPI.js\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## What's next?\n\nWithout any obligation nor due date, one could expect to be done this non-exhaustive [list of improvements grouped on issues labeled `Feature`](https://gitlab.com/clorichel/vue-github-api/issues?scope=all&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93&label_name%5B%5D=Feature).\n\nYou can read on the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) too, for historical and upcoming new features, changes, deprecations, removed features, bug and security fixes.\n\n## Support\n\nYour are free to [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/clorichel/vue-github-api/issues/new) right in this GitLab repository whether you should be facing a problem or a bug.
