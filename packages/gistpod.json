In fact, that's pretty much the only reason I made this.\n\nGiven how much of the Swift code out in the wild still has no official podspec (and, for that matter, given all of the one-page microclasses I've found myself writing in Swift), I've been using **gists** (<https://gist.github.com>) pretty frequently to deal with temporary (and rapidly-changing) podspecs during fast development cycles.\n\nBut the problem, as far as I can tell, is that any time you commit a change to a gist, the raw gist URL changes.  (I'm not aware of any redirect URL to the actual raw source... is anyone else?).  That means that every time you change a podspec, you'll be stuck copying its new gist URL around to all of your `Podfiles` manually.\n\n**Can NOT be trifling with that.**  I'd much rather just `Cmd-Tab` into iTerm and run something... like...\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod update\n\nPodfile updated.\n```\n\n\n\n# moar examples\n\n```\n $ gistpod list\n\nPod                      Podspec gist URL\n-------------------      ------------------------------------------------------------------\nReactiveCocoaSwift       https://gist.github.com/brynbellomy/.../ReactiveCocoaSwift.podspec\nJSTilemap                https://gist.github.com/brynbellomy/.../JSTilemap.podspec\nSignals                  https://gist.github.com/brynbellomy/.../Signals.podspec\nStarscream               https://gist.github.com/brynbellomy/.../Starscream.podspec\nBasis                    https://gist.github.com/brynbellomy/.../Basis.podspec\n\n# the update command is:\n# $ gistpod update [Podfile directory] [pods to update]\n$ gistpod update . Starscream ReactiveCocoa-Swift\n\nPodfile updated.\n```\n\n- `gistpod list`:\n    \n    0. queries your GitHub account for all gists containing at least one `podspec` file â€” i.e., matching the pattern `*.podspec`...\n    0. ...and displays the direct, raw URL to the latest revision of each podspec's gist.\n\n    *(Note: just to be totally clear, I added the dot-dot-dots.  The command gives the full path.)*\n\n-------------\n\n- `gistpod update`:\n\n    0. **backs up** `<project root>/Podfile` to `~/.gistpod-backup`, ...\n    0. **reads your Podfile template** from `<project root>/Podfile.gistpod`, and then ...\n    0. **writes an updated Podfile** to `<project root>/Podfile`.  Each pod placeholder (`#{Starscream}`, etc.) is replaced by its respective URL (from the `gistpod list` command).\n    \n    Now you can `pod install` your heart out, confident that your jank-ass, ghetto-rigged (\"dev\") in-house podspecs are all at least referencing the latest commits in your gist account.\n\n-------------\n\n\n\n# install\n\nInstall with `npm`\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g gistpod\n```\n\nSet your GitHub username (one-time):\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod username brynbellomy\n```\n\nNow you can list all of the podspecs that you have stored as gists:\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod list\n```\n\n_**@@TODO:** display a diff if there were any changes_\n\n\n\n\n# main usage/workflow\n\n### 1. Make a copy of your `Podfile` called `Podfile.gistpod`.\n\nPut it in `<project root>`, alongside the original:\n\n```sh\n$ cp Podfile Podfile.gistpod\n```\n\n### 2. Open `Podfile.gistpod`.\n\nYou will need to change the `:podspec => '...'` URLs for any of the podspecs that you want to keep automatically synced with your gists account.  The entire podspec URL (including quotes) must be replaced with the placeholder `#{PodName}`.\n\n**In other words,** change this:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :osx, '10.10'\n\npod 'Starscream', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/dfd19ac23..../Starscream.podspec'\npod 'ReactiveCocoa-Swift', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/fdc2a3d19..../ReactiveCocoa-Swift.podspec'\n```\n\n...to this:\n\n```ruby\nplatform :osx, '10.10'\n\npod 'Starscream', :podspec => #{Starscream}\npod 'ReactiveCocoa-Swift', :podspec => #{ReactiveCocoa-Swift}\n```\n\n\n\n### 3. Update your local cache of podspec URLs with `gistpod pull`.\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod pull\n```\n\n_**@@TODO:** display a diff if there were any changes_\n\n\n\n\n### 4. Run `gistpod update` to update the URLs in your `Podfile`.\n\nThis does the inverse of **step 3**: it finds all of those `#{PodPlaceholders}` in your `Podfile.gistpod` and replaces each one with the latest commit URL for its respective podspec.\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod update [optional path to Podfile] [optional list of pods to update]\n```\n\nAny time you run `gistpod update`, your `Podfile` is backed up (to `~/.gistpod-backup`) and then overwritten with a new `Podfile` built from its accompanying `Podfile.gistpod`.  The `#{PodPlaceholders}` will be replaced by URLs pointing at the latest revision of each of your gist podspecs on GitHub.\n\n\n\n# other commands\n\nThe `gistpod url` command returns *only* the gist URL for a given podspec (and not a byte more or less):\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod url Starscream\n```\n\nThis is useful if you're doing any kind of shell scripting, or if you want to (painlessly) copy the URL to the clipboard, or...\n\n```sh\n$ gistpod url Starscream | pbcopy\n```\n\n\n\n\n# authors\n\nbryn austin bellomy < <bryn.bellomy@gmail.com> >\n\n","created":"2015-01-09T07:54:15.263Z","modified":"2015-01-26T21:35:41.595Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"brynb","email":"bryn.bellomy@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"brynb","email":"bryn.bellomy@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gistpod","_nodeVersion":"0.11.14","_npmUser":{"name":"brynb","email":"bryn.bellomy@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.1.18","_rev":"1-767d269abcb9c54f330c4df0d342bc45","_shasum":"9bbb6dad274eb8a1b20815174c930431585f48b7","author":{"name":"bryn austin bellomy","email":"bryn.bellomy@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/brynbellomy/gistpod/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.2.2"},"dist":{"shasum":"9bbb6dad274eb8a1b20815174c930431585f48b7","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/gistpod/-/gistpod-0.2.2.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"brynb","email":"bryn.bellomy@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-01-26T21:35:41.595Z","created":"2015-01-09T07:54:15.263Z","0.0.1":"2015-01-09T07:54:15.263Z","0.0.2":"2015-01-09T11:43:44.158Z","0.0.3":"2015-01-12T02:49:58.626Z","0.0.4":"2015-01-12T04:48:43.036Z","0.0.5":"2015-01-12T05:41:50.332Z","0.0.6":"2015-01-15T04:09:35.676Z","0.1.0":"2015-01-15T06:35:43.590Z","0.1.2":"2015-01-25T11:20:47.163Z","0.2.0":"2015-01-26T08:51:47.843Z","0.2.1":"2015-01-26T08:53:27.258Z","0.2.2":"2015-01-26T21:35:41.595Z"}}}
