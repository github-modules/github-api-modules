It does not appear when Markdown is rendered.\n#### Full example:\n```\n# v0.2.0\n## Use env variable for Github token\nYou should now expose the github token as GITHUB_TOKEN in env variables\n\n<!-- -->\n\n# v0.1.0\n## Different changelog separator\n### What it does\nLalala\n\n<!-- -->\n\n//...\n```\n### Export a GITHUB_TOKEN env variable\nEither locally with `export GITHUB_TOKEN=$yourToken` or in your CI tool settings (see CircleCI example).\n\n### Example of package.json\nDon't forget the `repository.fullname`.\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"respository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"fullname\": \"myOrg/myRepo\",\n    \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/myOrg/myRepo.git\"\n  },\n  \"files\": [\"dist\"],\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": // build dist files\n    \"release\": \"npm publish && npm run release-to-github-with-changelog\",\n    \"release\": \"npm publish && npm run release-to-github-with-changelog --branch=releases\", // optional branch name\n    \"test\": // your test command\n  }\n}\n```\n## CI example\n`circle.yml`\n```\nmachine:\n  node:\n    version: 4.1.0\ndependencies:\n  pre:\n    - echo -e \"$NPM_USER\\n$NPM_PASS\\n$NPM_EMAIL\" | npm login\ndeployment:\n  production:\n    branch: master\n    commands:\n      - npm run release\n```\n","created":"2016-07-23T16:33:03.075Z","modified":"2017-03-14T10:36:34.375Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"adriendog","email":"adrien.vaschalde@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"adriendog","email":"adrien.vaschalde@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"release-to-github-with-changelog","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/release-to-github-with-changelog-0.7.0.tgz_1489487791998_0.8507994031533599"},"_npmUser":{"name":"adriendog","email":"adrien.vaschalde@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"10-0e78ae6a7a39fd1f0e3da29a52efce8c","_shasum":"2b1701e6a074445f0aaa5edecfda4fe3438b2a95","author":{"name":"adrienDog"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/adriendog/release-to-github-with-changelog/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.7.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"2b1701e6a074445f0aaa5edecfda4fe3438b2a95","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/release-to-github-with-changelog/-/release-to-github-with-changelog-0.7.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"adriendog","email":"adrien.vaschalde@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2017-03-14T10:36:34.375Z","created":"2016-07-23T16:33:03.075Z","0.0.2":"2016-07-23T16:33:03.075Z","0.1.1":"2016-07-23T16:51:02.506Z","0.2.1":"2016-07-23T17:27:20.848Z","0.2.2":"2016-07-23T17:42:31.623Z","0.2.3":"2016-07-24T14:04:50.792Z","0.2.4":"2016-07-25T09:28:05.663Z","0.2.5":"2016-07-25T09:58:08.693Z","0.3.0":"2016-09-13T06:36:45.652Z","0.3.1":"2016-09-13T06:49:54.375Z","0.5.0":"2016-11-18T10:33:46.786Z","0.5.1":"2016-11-18T10:41:12.016Z","0.5.2":"2016-11-18T13:25:57.910Z","0.5.3":"2016-11-18T13:34:35.708Z","0.5.4":"2016-11-18T17:18:50.074Z","0.5.5":"2016-12-09T13:56:55.620Z","0.6.0":"2016-12-19T15:47:59.459Z","0.6.1":"2016-12-19T15:59:44.655Z","0.7.0":"2017-03-14T10:36:34.375Z"}}}
