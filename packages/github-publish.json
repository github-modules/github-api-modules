Returns a `Promise` which resolves to the `sha` of the created object on success and to `false` on failure (failure is likely caused by a collision with a pre-existing file, as long as one haven't specified that it should be overridden).\n\n## `publish()` options\n\n* **force** – whether to replace any pre-existing file no matter what\n* **message** – a custom commit message. Default is `new content`\n* **sha** – the sha of an existing file that one wants to replace\n","created":"2015-07-02T16:35:38.082Z","modified":"2016-10-23T19:32:43.208Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"voxpelli","email":"pelle@kodfabrik.se"},"owners":[{"name":"voxpelli","email":"pelle@kodfabrik.se"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"github-publish","_nodeVersion":"6.9.1","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-12-west.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/github-publish-2.0.0.tgz_1477251161298_0.9510965249501169"},"_npmUser":{"name":"voxpelli","email":"pelle@kodfabrik.se"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"2-9a4aef92b86b848b95a674c36e461c65","_shasum":"74ceeec7344fce823b02022f36dcd430c3da07d0","author":{"name":"Pelle Wessman","email":"pelle@kodfabrik.se","url":"http://kodfabrik.se/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/voxpelli/node-github-publish/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"74ceeec7344fce823b02022f36dcd430c3da07d0","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/github-publish/-/github-publish-2.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"voxpelli","email":"pelle@kodfabrik.se"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-10-23T19:32:43.208Z","created":"2015-07-02T16:35:38.082Z","0.1.0":"2015-07-02T16:35:38.082Z","0.1.2":"2015-07-02T16:40:32.542Z","0.1.3":"2015-07-07T09:48:26.378Z","0.1.4":"2015-07-07T09:55:31.131Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-17T11:50:04.950Z","1.0.1":"2015-07-20T10:46:21.040Z","1.1.0":"2015-07-21T17:44:20.071Z","2.0.0":"2016-10-23T19:32:43.208Z"}}}
