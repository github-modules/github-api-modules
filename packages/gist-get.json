It uses the request module to send GET requests to the api.\n\n`var gist = require('gist-get');`\n\n### methods\n\n`gist.get(id, [opts], callback)`\n\n`id` is a gist id, such as 0d1faa46f230d941e184.\n\n`opts` is an optional object, with one field, \"headers\". This can be used to specify the headers for the request. It defaults to the value of `require('github-api-base').headers`. This default exists to ensure that a User-Agent header is sent with the request, as required by the github api.\n\n`callback(err, result)` will be passed the result of `JSON.parse(body)`, which is a javascript object representing the requested gist, assuming no errors.\n\n`gist.version(id, version, [opts], callback)`\n\n`version` is a revision hash, for requesting a specific revision of a gist, such as 70dc7bf945f1577eb650c6a6658b6e91973b836e.\nThe other parameters are the same as for `gist.get`.\n\n`gist.latest(id, [opts], callback)`\n\n`callback(err, result)` will, on success, be passed an object of the form `{ version: \"70dc7bf945f1577eb650c6a6658b6e91973b836e\", committed_at: \"2014-10-22T23:43:30Z\" }` corresponding to the version and commit time of the most recent version of the requested gist.\n","starsCount":1,"created":"2015-02-24T00:26:25.545Z","modified":"2015-02-25T22:31:30.666Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"phoenixstormcrow","email":"phoenixstormcrow@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"phoenixstormcrow","email":"phoenixstormcrow@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"gist-get","_nodeVersion":"0.11.12","_npmUser":{"name":"phoenixstormcrow","email":"phoenixstormcrow@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-8df6ff39fc36b7a3526e6bc72348fa3e","_shasum":"18286c84612844b248e0777db02a4b06b8a9178f","author":{"name":"Phoenix Stormcrow"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/phoenixstormcrow/gist-get/issues"},"directories":{"test":"test"},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"18286c84612844b248e0777db02a4b06b8a9178f","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/gist-get/-/gist-get-2.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"phoenixstormcrow","email":"phoenixstormcrow@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-02-25T22:31:30.666Z","created":"2015-02-24T00:26:25.545Z","1.0.0":"2015-02-24T00:26:25.545Z","1.0.1":"2015-02-24T01:05:04.122Z","1.0.2":"2015-02-24T01:34:06.578Z","1.0.3":"2015-02-24T02:23:32.919Z","1.1.0":"2015-02-25T03:20:05.920Z","2.0.0":"2015-02-25T22:31:30.666Z"},"users":{"battlemidget":true}}}
