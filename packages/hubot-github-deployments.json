Combined with a deployment tool that listens to organizational or repository [DeploymentEvent](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#deploymentevent) webhooks, this module can help automate that process via ChatOps.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn your hubot repository, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-github-deployments --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-github-deployments** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\"hubot-github-deployments\"]\n```\n\n## Configuration:\n\n### Heroku\n\n```\nheroku config:set HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=<User Application Token>\nheroku config:set HUBOT_GITHUB_USER=<User for Deployments>\nheroku config:set HUBOT_GITHUB_DEPLOY_TARGETS=<Comma Seperated List of Environments>\nheroku config:set HUBOT_GITHUB_REPO=<Repository to deploy, in :user_or_org/:repository format>\n```\n\n### Standard\n\n```\nexport HUBOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=<User Application Token>\nexport HUBOT_GITHUB_USER=<User for Deployments>\nexport HUBOT_GITHUB_DEPLOY_TARGETS=<Comma Seperated List of Environments>\nexport HUBOT_GITHUB_REPO=<Repository to deploy, in :user_or_org/:repository format>\n```\n\n## Commands:\n\n- `hubot deploy status` - List the status of most recent deployments\n- `hubot deploy status <id>` - List the statuses a particular deployment\n- `hubot deploy list targets` - List available deployment targets\n- `hubot deploy list branches <search>` - List available branches, filtered by optional search term\n- `hubot deploy <branch or SHA> to <server>` - Creates a Github deployment of a branch/SHA to a server\n","created":"2015-02-12T06:12:52.483Z","modified":"2015-02-12T06:12:52.483Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"},"owners":[{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"hubot-github-deployments","_nodeVersion":"0.12.0","_npmUser":{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"},"_npmVersion":"2.5.1","_rev":"1-0a3c91668407b22d547f61f9ab9ce0a2","_shasum":"35ff168e3f3572b957a2dd8fb121d99d3d6dab3c","author":{"name":"stephenyeargin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/stephenyeargin/hubot-github-deployments/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"1.0.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"35ff168e3f3572b957a2dd8fb121d99d3d6dab3c","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/hubot-github-deployments/-/hubot-github-deployments-1.0.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"stephenyeargin","email":"stephen@yearg.in"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2015-02-12T06:12:52.483Z","created":"2015-02-12T06:12:52.483Z","1.0.0":"2015-02-12T06:12:52.483Z"}}}
