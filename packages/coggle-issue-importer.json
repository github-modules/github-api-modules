The [passport-coggle-oauth2](https://github.com/coggle/passport-coggle-oauth2) module used to authorize users with Coggle, and retrieve an access token that can be sent along with requests to prove that your application is allowed to access a user's Coggles.\n\n### Try It [Here](http://github2coggle.herokuapp.com)!\n\n### Get the Code!\n\nFirst install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/), then:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:Coggle/coggle-issue-importer.git\ncd coggle-issue-importer\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Running Coggle Issue Importer\n\nTo use the Coggle API you need a Client ID, and a Client Secret – which Coggle uses to identify requests to the applications that made them.\n\nA new Client ID and Client Secret can be created at\n[http://coggle.it/developer](http://coggle.it/developer). The redirect URL\nshould be the domain (and optionally port) where you will host the application\n(for example, `localhost` or `localhost:5000` for testing) followed by\n`/auth/coggle/callback`, which is the Coggle oauth authentication callback\nroute of the app.\n\nSince the app also uses the GitHub API, you also need a github API client ID\nand client secret (get one\n[here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)). The callback URL for\ngithub authorization is (as you'd expect) the domain followed by\n`/auth/github/callback`.\n\nBoth these pairs of IDs and secrets then need to be provided as environment\nvariables when you run the app. If they are missing the app will refuse to\nstart – but if they are incorrect you will only find out when you try to use\nit!\n\n```bash\nCOGGLE_CLIENT_ID=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa \\\nCOGGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb \\\nGITHUB_CLIENT_ID=cccccccccccccccccccc \\\nGITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd \\\nnode app.js\n```\n\n\n### License\n[The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n\n","created":"2014-07-13T10:24:48.541Z","modified":"2014-07-20T15:21:55.538Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"autopulated","email":"autopulated@gmail.com"},"owners":[{"name":"autopulated","email":"autopulated@gmail.com"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"coggle-issue-importer","_npmUser":{"name":"autopulated","email":"autopulated@gmail.com"},"_npmVersion":"1.4.3","_rev":"1-e20f4a8c7a0e733e4a773b0bb6787e38","author":{"name":"James Crosby","email":"james@coggle.it","url":"http://coggle.it/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Coggle/coggle-issue-importer/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"0.0.1"},"dist":{"shasum":"6b224f30657425e58b2facbf6da0b8fc32d6bcfe","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/coggle-issue-importer/-/coggle-issue-importer-0.0.1.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"autopulated","email":"autopulated@gmail.com"}],"readmeFilename":"readme.md","time":{"modified":"2014-07-20T15:21:55.538Z","created":"2014-07-13T10:24:48.541Z","0.0.0":"2014-07-13T10:24:48.541Z","0.0.1":"2014-07-20T15:21:55.538Z"}}}
