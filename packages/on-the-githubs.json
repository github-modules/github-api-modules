http://kvz.github.io/on-the-githubs/#repos/`{user}`/`{repo}`\n - http://kvz.github.io/on-the-githubs/#users/`{user}`\n - http://kvz.github.io/on-the-githubs/#orgs/`{org}`\n\nTo embed this into your site, add a few lines of code:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"//kvz.github.io/on-the-githubs/css/on-the-githubs.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n\n<div class=\"on-the-githubs\" data-event-source=\"repos/kvz/nsfailover\">Loading...</div>\n\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"//kvz.github.io/on-the-githubs/js/jquery.on-the-githubs.min.js\"></script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  $('.on-the-githubs').onthegithubs();\n  // If you use bootstrap and want to enable tooltips\n  // $('a[rel]').tooltip();\n</script>\n```\n\nDon't forget to change the `data-event-source` to repos/`{user}`/`{repo}`.\n\n## On the Githubs development\n\nFor local development, here's how to run the repo-included demo:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --dev\nmake build\nnode demo-server.js\n```\n\n- Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080\n\n\n# Bonus: In the Githubs\n\nActivity is limited to the last 20-100 events, but communities grow big.\nIf you want to give credit where credit is due and show all the faces that make your community,\nwe can't just pull that in in realtime from the API without hindering the UI or hitting GitHub's\nrate-limiter.\n\nSo this is something we have to aggregate, cache, and compile at your site's buildtime.\n\n## In the Githubs examples\n\nGet all people involved with `kvz/nsfailver` and echo as json to `stdout`\n\n```bash\n./bin/in-the-githubs --user kvz --repo nsfailover --format json --output -\n```\n\nIndex an entire organization, read `test/about.md`, search it for the `{{community}}` tag,\nreplace it with the entire `tus` community, write it to `test/about-with-community.md`, do this with `1` request at a time, to ensure the order of userpaths. Enable `debug`ging to see what's going on, because with the amount of API requests & GitHubs rate-limiting, this is going to take a while (the script automatically waits as to not have your IP banned by GitHub).\n\n```bash\n./bin/in-the-githubs \\\n --user tus \\\n --repo tus.io,tusd,tus-jquery-client,tus-ios-client,tus-android-client,tus-resumable-upload-protocol \\\n --format html \\\n --concurrency 1 \\\n --input demo.html \\\n --tag '<div class=\"in-the-githubs\" />' \\\n --output demo-with-community.html \\\n --debug\n```\n\nHelp:\n\n```bash\n./bin/in-the-githubs -h\n```\n\n## Integrate In the Githubs\n\nLet's say your site is now built with Jekyll into `./_site`.\nYou have an `about.md` that you want to add community faces to.\n\nFirst, let's make on-the-githubs a dependency:\n\n```bash\n[ -d node_modules ] || mkdir node_modules\nnpm install on-the-githubs --save\n```\n\nNow add something like this to a `Makefile`:\n\n```bash\ncommunity:\n\tnode_modules/on-the-githubs/bin/in-the-githubs \\\n\t --user tus \\\n\t --repo tusd,tus-jquery-client \\\n\t --format html \\\n\t --concurrency 1 \\\n\t --input _site/about.html \\\n\t --tag '<p>replaced-by-in-the-githubs</p>' \\\n\t --output _site/about.html \\\n\t --debug\n```\n\nNow if you type `make community` after `jekyll build`, `in-the-githubs` will look for the\n`<p>replaced-by-in-the-githubs</p>` placeholder, and replace it with all the involved GitHub\nprofiles.\n\nBy default, `in-the-githubs` caches to `~/.in-the-githubs/` to avoid rate-limiters.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Node 0.8+\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license, see `LICENSE.txt`.\n\nContains code of [jquery-timeago](https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago)\nby [Ryan McGeary](https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n","created":"2013-07-03T10:08:08.482Z","modified":"2016-12-20T14:15:13.482Z","lastPublisher":{"name":"kvz","email":"kevin@vanzonneveld.net"},"owners":[{"name":"kvz","email":"kevin@vanzonneveld.net"}],"other":{"_attachments":{},"_from":".","_id":"on-the-githubs","_nodeVersion":"7.0.0","_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"packages-18-east.internal.npmjs.com","tmp":"tmp/on-the-githubs-2.4.0.tgz_1482243312701_0.943273869343102"},"_npmUser":{"name":"kvz","email":"kevin@vanzonneveld.net"},"_npmVersion":"3.10.8","_rev":"2-b1ff6a284a3752b49eac47a8f7a83c34","_shasum":"6021eec41278f77e87d39a561b4ff20043345beb","author":{"name":"Kevin van Zonneveld","email":"kevin@vanzonneveld.net"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/kvz/on-the-githubs/issues"},"directories":{},"dist-tags":{"latest":"2.4.0"},"dist":{"shasum":"6021eec41278f77e87d39a561b4ff20043345beb","tarball":"http://registry.npmjs.org/on-the-githubs/-/on-the-githubs-2.4.0.tgz"},"maintainers":[{"name":"kvz","email":"kevin@vanzonneveld.net"}],"readmeFilename":"README.md","time":{"modified":"2016-12-20T14:15:13.482Z","created":"2013-07-03T10:08:08.482Z","0.0.1":"2013-07-03T10:08:09.890Z","1.0.0":"2013-07-04T13:31:07.950Z","1.1.0":"2013-07-04T14:08:26.133Z","1.2.1":"2013-07-04T15:24:39.018Z","1.3.0":"2013-07-04T17:57:06.395Z","1.3.6":"2013-08-13T11:54:11.512Z","1.3.7":"2013-08-13T13:52:06.589Z","1.3.8":"2013-08-13T14:54:18.437Z","1.3.9":"2013-08-13T15:05:39.003Z","1.4.0":"2013-08-13T15:09:37.871Z","1.4.1":"2013-08-13T15:27:59.060Z","1.4.2":"2013-08-13T15:30:03.038Z","2.0.0":"2013-08-14T15:44:29.570Z","2.0.1":"2013-08-30T13:39:58.135Z","2.0.2":"2013-08-30T13:43:14.115Z","2.0.3":"2013-08-30T13:53:26.373Z","2.0.4":"2013-08-30T14:04:36.022Z","2.0.5":"2013-08-30T14:05:45.590Z","2.0.6":"2013-08-30T14:46:39.959Z","2.0.7":"2013-09-02T14:32:21.934Z","2.1.8":"2014-03-04T20:31:23.054Z","2.1.9":"2014-03-04T20:48:33.645Z","2.1.10":"2014-03-04T20:49:32.099Z","2.1.11":"2014-03-04T20:54:30.719Z","2.2.0":"2014-12-10T22:44:26.392Z","2.2.1":"2015-04-29T18:25:54.922Z","2.3.0":"2015-09-19T12:59:28.059Z","2.3.1":"2016-05-23T18:47:33.105Z","2.3.2":"2016-05-23T18:49:14.594Z","2.4.0":"2016-12-20T14:15:13.482Z"}}}
